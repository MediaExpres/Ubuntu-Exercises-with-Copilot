Challenge #1

Using tar, create an archive of /etc in the current directory.
Display the contents of the archive searching for a specific file in the archive.
Extract the archive in the current directory.

COPILOT solution:
Here are the steps to complete the challenge:

To create an archive of /etc in the current directory, use the following command:
sudo tar -cvzf etc_archive.tar.gz /etc                                                      # Andrei solution is: sudo tar -cvz etc.tar /etc which throws error:
This will create an archive named etc_archive.tar.gz in the current directory.              mihai@mihai-Legion:~$ sudo tar -cvz etc.tar /etc
                                                                                            tar: Refusing to write archive contents to terminal (missing -f option?)
                                                                                            tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now => adding f solve it

To display the contents of the archive and search for a specific file, use the following command:
tar -tvf etc_archive.tar.gz | grep <file_name>                                              # Andrei solution is: tar -tvf etc.tar /etc | grep passwd
mihai@mihai-Legion:~$ tar -tvf etc.tar etc | grep passwd
-rw-r--r-- root/root      2959 2024-01-18 18:04 etc/passwd-
-rw-r--r-- root/root        92 2021-11-11 17:42 etc/pam.d/chpasswd
-rw-r--r-- root/root        92 2021-11-11 17:42 etc/pam.d/passwd
-rw------- root/root         0 2024-01-09 14:59 etc/security/opasswd
-rw-r--r-- root/root      2996 2024-01-21 13:36 etc/passwd

Replace <file_name> with the name of the file you want to search for. This command will display the contents of the archive and search for the specified file.

To extract the archive in the current directory, use the following command:
tar -xvzf etc_archive.tar.gz -C .

This will extract the archive in the current directory.

Please note that the sudo command is used in step 1 to ensure that all files in /etc are readable by the user. Also, the -C option in step 3 is used to extract the archive in the current directory. If you want to extract the archive in a different directory, replace . with the path of the directory where you want to extract the archive.
