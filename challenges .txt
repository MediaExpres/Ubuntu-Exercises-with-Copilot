Paths, ls, File Timestamps and Types, Viewing Files

Challenge #1

Move into the current user’s home directory using the cd command.
List the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path.
Display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and an absolute path.
Move into the root directory (/) using an absolute path.
List the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path.

Copilot:
To move into the current user’s home directory using the cd command, you can type cd ~ or cd $HOME in the terminal. The tilde (~) and the environment variable $HOME both represent the current user’s home directory.
To list the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path, you can type ls /etc in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /etc directory, which contains system configuration files.
To display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and an absolute path, you can type cat /var/log/dmesg in the terminal. This will show you the output of the dmesg command, which prints the messages from the kernel ring buffer. The /var/log/dmesg file stores these messages for later inspection.
To move into the root directory (/) using an absolute path, you can type cd / in the terminal. This will change your current working directory to the root directory, which is the top-level directory in the file system hierarchy.
To list the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path, you can repeat the same command as before: ls /etc. This will show you the same output as before, since you are listing the same directory.

Challenge #2

Move into the current user’s home directory using the cd command and an absolute path.
List the contents of the current directory using the ls command and a relative path.
List the contents of /home using the ls command and an absolute path.
List the contents of /home using the ls command and a relative path.
List the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path.
List the contents of /etc using the ls command and a relative path.
Display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and an absolute path.
Display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and a relative path.

To move into the current user’s home directory using the cd command and an absolute path, you need to know the name of the current user. You can find out the name of the current user by typing `whoami` in the terminal. This will print the username of the current user. For example, if the current user is named alice, then the absolute path of the home directory is /home/alice. To change the current working directory to the home directory, you can type `cd /home/alice` in the terminal.
To list the contents of the current directory using the ls command and a relative path, you can simply type `ls` in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the current directory, which is the home directory in this case. A relative path is a path that does not start with a slash (/), and is relative to the current working directory. For example, if you want to list the contents of the Documents directory inside the home directory, you can type `ls Documents` in the terminal.
To list the contents of /home using the ls command and an absolute path, you can type `ls /home` in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /home directory, which contains the home directories of all the users on the system. An absolute path is a path that starts with a slash (/), and is not dependent on the current working directory. For example, if you want to list the contents of the /etc directory, you can type `ls /etc` in the terminal, regardless of where you are.
To list the contents of /home using the ls command and a relative path, you need to know the relative path from the current working directory to the /home directory. Since the current working directory is the home directory of the current user, the relative path to the /home directory is .. (two dots). The two dots represent the parent directory of the current directory. To list the contents of the /home directory using a relative path, you can type `ls ..` in the terminal.
To list the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path, you can type `ls /etc` in the terminal, as mentioned before. This will show you the same output as before, since you are listing the same directory.
To list the contents of /etc using the ls command and a relative path, you need to know the relative path from the current working directory to the /etc directory. Since the current working directory is the home directory of the current user, the relative path to the /etc directory is ../../etc. The ../../ represents the parent directory of the parent directory of the current directory, which is the root directory (/). To list the contents of the /etc directory using a relative path, you can type `ls ../../etc` in the terminal.
To display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and an absolute path, you can type `cat /var/log/dmesg` in the terminal, as mentioned before. This will show you the same output as before, since you are displaying the same file.
To display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and a relative path, you need to know the relative path from the current working directory to the /var/log/dmesg file. Since the current working directory is the home directory of the current user, the relative path to the /var/log/dmesg file is ../../var/log/dmesg. To display the contents of the /var/log/dmesg file using a relative path, you can type `cat ../../var/log/dmesg` in the terminal.

Challenge #3

Move into the root directory (/) using the cd command and an absolute path.
Display the contents of /var/log/boot.log using the cat command and a relative path.
Run the previous command as root.
Move to /var/log directory using an absolute path.
Display the contents of the Desktop directory using both an absolute and relative path.
Here are the steps to complete the challenge #3:

- To move into the root directory (/) using the cd command and an absolute path, you can type `cd /` in the terminal. This will change your current working directory to the root directory, which is the top-level directory in the file system hierarchy.
- To display the contents of /var/log/boot.log using the cat command and a relative path, you need to know the relative path from the current working directory to the /var/log/boot.log file. Since the current working directory is the root directory (/), the relative path to the /var/log/boot.log file is var/log/boot.log. To display the contents of the /var/log/boot.log file using a relative path, you can type `cat var/log/boot.log` in the terminal. This will show you the messages from the boot process of the system.
*** the above throws error sudo is needed 
- To run the previous command as root, you need to use the sudo command, which allows you to execute commands as another user, usually the superuser or root. The root user has the highest privileges and can access and modify any file or directory on the system. To run the previous command as root, you can type `sudo cat var/log/boot.log` in the terminal. This will prompt you to enter your password, and then display the contents of the /var/log/boot.log file as root.
- To move to /var/log directory using an absolute path, you can type `cd /var/log` in the terminal. This will change your current working directory to the /var/log directory, which contains various log files from different system services and applications.
- To display the contents of the Desktop directory using both an absolute and relative path, you need to know the absolute and relative paths from the current working directory to the Desktop directory. The absolute path of the Desktop directory is /home/username/Desktop, where username is the name of the current user. You can find out the name of the current user by typing `whoami` in the terminal. The relative path of the Desktop directory is ../../home/username/Desktop, which means going up two levels from the current directory (/var/log) to the root directory (/), and then going down to the home directory (/home), the user's home directory (/home/username), and the Desktop directory (/home/username/Desktop). To display the contents of the Desktop directory using an absolute path, you can type `ls /home/username/Desktop` in the terminal. To display the contents of the Desktop directory using a relative path, you can type `ls ../../home/username/Desktop` in the terminal. Both commands will show you the same output, which is the list of files and directories on the Desktop.
*** no ~ command as instructed in Dumitrescu solutions:
ls /home/student/Desktop/
ls ~/Desktop/
ls ../../home/student/Desktop/
