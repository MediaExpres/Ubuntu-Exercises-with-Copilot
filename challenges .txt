Paths, ls, File Timestamps and Types, Viewing Files

Challenge #1

Move into the current user’s home directory using the cd command.
List the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path.
Display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and an absolute path.
Move into the root directory (/) using an absolute path.
List the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path.

Copilot:
To move into the current user’s home directory using the cd command, you can type cd ~ or cd $HOME in the terminal. The tilde (~) and the environment variable $HOME both represent the current user’s home directory.
To list the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path, you can type ls /etc in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /etc directory, which contains system configuration files.
To display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and an absolute path, you can type cat /var/log/dmesg in the terminal. This will show you the output of the dmesg command, which prints the messages from the kernel ring buffer. The /var/log/dmesg file stores these messages for later inspection.
To move into the root directory (/) using an absolute path, you can type cd / in the terminal. This will change your current working directory to the root directory, which is the top-level directory in the file system hierarchy.
To list the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path, you can repeat the same command as before: ls /etc. This will show you the same output as before, since you are listing the same directory.

Challenge #2

Move into the current user’s home directory using the cd command and an absolute path.
List the contents of the current directory using the ls command and a relative path.
List the contents of /home using the ls command and an absolute path.
List the contents of /home using the ls command and a relative path.
List the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path.
List the contents of /etc using the ls command and a relative path.
Display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and an absolute path.
Display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and a relative path.

To move into the current user’s home directory using the cd command and an absolute path, you need to know the name of the current user. You can find out the name of the current user by typing `whoami` in the terminal. This will print the username of the current user. For example, if the current user is named alice, then the absolute path of the home directory is /home/alice. To change the current working directory to the home directory, you can type `cd /home/alice` in the terminal.
To list the contents of the current directory using the ls command and a relative path, you can simply type `ls` in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the current directory, which is the home directory in this case. A relative path is a path that does not start with a slash (/), and is relative to the current working directory. For example, if you want to list the contents of the Documents directory inside the home directory, you can type `ls Documents` in the terminal.
To list the contents of /home using the ls command and an absolute path, you can type `ls /home` in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /home directory, which contains the home directories of all the users on the system. An absolute path is a path that starts with a slash (/), and is not dependent on the current working directory. For example, if you want to list the contents of the /etc directory, you can type `ls /etc` in the terminal, regardless of where you are.
To list the contents of /home using the ls command and a relative path, you need to know the relative path from the current working directory to the /home directory. Since the current working directory is the home directory of the current user, the relative path to the /home directory is .. (two dots). The two dots represent the parent directory of the current directory. To list the contents of the /home directory using a relative path, you can type `ls ..` in the terminal.
To list the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path, you can type `ls /etc` in the terminal, as mentioned before. This will show you the same output as before, since you are listing the same directory.
To list the contents of /etc using the ls command and a relative path, you need to know the relative path from the current working directory to the /etc directory. Since the current working directory is the home directory of the current user, the relative path to the /etc directory is ../../etc. The ../../ represents the parent directory of the parent directory of the current directory, which is the root directory (/). To list the contents of the /etc directory using a relative path, you can type `ls ../../etc` in the terminal.
To display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and an absolute path, you can type `cat /var/log/dmesg` in the terminal, as mentioned before. This will show you the same output as before, since you are displaying the same file.
To display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and a relative path, you need to know the relative path from the current working directory to the /var/log/dmesg file. Since the current working directory is the home directory of the current user, the relative path to the /var/log/dmesg file is ../../var/log/dmesg. To display the contents of the /var/log/dmesg file using a relative path, you can type `cat ../../var/log/dmesg` in the terminal.

Challenge #3

Move into the root directory (/) using the cd command and an absolute path.
Display the contents of /var/log/boot.log using the cat command and a relative path.
Run the previous command as root.
Move to /var/log directory using an absolute path.
Display the contents of the Desktop directory using both an absolute and relative path.
Here are the steps to complete the challenge #3:

- To move into the root directory (/) using the cd command and an absolute path, you can type `cd /` in the terminal. This will change your current working directory to the root directory, which is the top-level directory in the file system hierarchy.
- To display the contents of /var/log/boot.log using the cat command and a relative path, you need to know the relative path from the current working directory to the /var/log/boot.log file. Since the current working directory is the root directory (/), the relative path to the /var/log/boot.log file is var/log/boot.log. To display the contents of the /var/log/boot.log file using a relative path, you can type `cat var/log/boot.log` in the terminal. This will show you the messages from the boot process of the system.
*** the above throws error sudo is needed 
- To run the previous command as root, you need to use the sudo command, which allows you to execute commands as another user, usually the superuser or root. The root user has the highest privileges and can access and modify any file or directory on the system. To run the previous command as root, you can type `sudo cat var/log/boot.log` in the terminal. This will prompt you to enter your password, and then display the contents of the /var/log/boot.log file as root.
- To move to /var/log directory using an absolute path, you can type `cd /var/log` in the terminal. This will change your current working directory to the /var/log directory, which contains various log files from different system services and applications.
- To display the contents of the Desktop directory using both an absolute and relative path, you need to know the absolute and relative paths from the current working directory to the Desktop directory. The absolute path of the Desktop directory is /home/username/Desktop, where username is the name of the current user. You can find out the name of the current user by typing `whoami` in the terminal. The relative path of the Desktop directory is ../../home/username/Desktop, which means going up two levels from the current directory (/var/log) to the root directory (/), and then going down to the home directory (/home), the user's home directory (/home/username), and the Desktop directory (/home/username/Desktop). To display the contents of the Desktop directory using an absolute path, you can type `ls /home/username/Desktop` in the terminal. To display the contents of the Desktop directory using a relative path, you can type `ls ../../home/username/Desktop` in the terminal. Both commands will show you the same output, which is the list of files and directories on the Desktop.
*** no ~ command as instructed in Dumitrescu solutions:
ls /home/student/Desktop/
ls ~/Desktop/
ls ../../home/student/Desktop/


Challenge #4

Display the man page of ls and search for -d option.
Display the contents of /var/log using a long listing format.
Display information about the /var/log directory in a long listing format.
Display the contents of /etc on a single column.
Display all the files and directories (including hidden ones) from the user's home directory.

Here are the steps to complete the challenge #4:

To display the man page of ls and search for -d option, you can type man ls in the terminal. This will open the manual page for the ls command, which shows the usage and options of the command. To search for the -d option, you can type / followed by -d and press Enter. This will highlight the first occurrence of the -d option in the man page. The -d option is used to list directories themselves, not their contents. To find the next occurrence of the -d option, you can press n. To exit the man page, you can press q.
To display the contents of /var/log using a long listing format, you can type ls -l /var/log in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /var/log directory, along with their permissions, ownership, size, modification date, and name. The -l option is used to use a long listing format, which provides more information than the default format.
To display information about the /var/log directory in a long listing format, you can type ls -ld /var/log in the terminal. This will show you only the information about the /var/log directory itself, not its contents. The -d option is used to list directories themselves, not their contents. The -l option is used to use a long listing format, as before.
To display the contents of /etc on a single column, you can type ls -1 /etc in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /etc directory, one per line. The -1 option is used to list one file per line, which creates a single column output.
To display all the files and directories (including hidden ones) from the user’s home directory, you can type ls -a ~ in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the user’s home directory, including those whose names start with a dot (.), which are hidden by default. The -a option is used to show all files, including hidden ones. The tilde (~) is used to represent the user’s home directory.
*** Dumitrescu solution is with -la 

Challenge #5

Display the contents of /var/log sorted by size in a human-readable format.
Rerun the previous command adding an option that omits the files that end in .log from listing.
List the contents of /etc recursively.

steps to complete the challenge #5:

To display the contents of /var/log sorted by size in a human-readable format, you can type ls -Sh /var/log in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /var/log directory, sorted by size in descending order, and with a suffix indicating the size unit (such as K for kilobytes, M for megabytes, etc.). The -S option is used to sort by size, and the -h option is used to make the sizes human-readable.
*** AI solution gives bytes in absolute numbers, Dumitrescu solution: -lSh gives the M, K bytes suffix
To rerun the previous command adding an option that omits the files that end in .log from listing, you can type ls -Sh --ignore='*.log' /var/log in the terminal. This will show you the same output as before, but without the files that end in .log. The --ignore option is used to exclude files that match a pattern, and the ‘*.log’ is a wildcard pattern that matches any file that ends with .log.
*** Dumitrescu: --hide=*.log 
To list the contents of /etc recursively, you can type ls -R /etc in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /etc directory, and also the files and directories in its subdirectories, and so on. The -R option is used to list recursively, which means to list all levels of the directory tree.
*** Dumitrescu: ls -lR /etc 

Challenge #6

Create a new file called linux.txt in the user’s home directory using the touch command.
Notice the file timestamps using both stat and ls commands.
Display the entire timestamp of the file using the ls command.

Here are the commands for challenge #6:

- To create a new file called linux.txt in the user’s home directory using the touch command, you can type `touch ~/linux.txt` in the terminal. This will create an empty file named linux.txt in the user's home directory, which is represented by the tilde (~).
- To notice the file timestamps using both stat and ls commands, you can type `stat ~/linux.txt` and `ls -l ~/linux.txt` in the terminal. This will show you the file attributes and the file permissions, ownership, size, modification date, and name, respectively. The file timestamps include the access time (atime), the modification time (mtime), and the change time (ctime), which indicate when the file was last read, written, or changed, respectively.
- To display the entire timestamp of the file using the ls command, you can type `ls -l --full-time ~/linux.txt` in the terminal. This will show you the same output as before, but with the full timestamp of the file, including the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and nanosecond. The --full-time option is used to show the full timestamp of the file.
*** Dumitrescu: ls -lu /linux.txt (from man ls:    -u     with  -lt:  sort  by, and show, access time; with -l: show access time and sort by name; otherwise: sort by access time, newest first) and everything else is not with ~


Challenge #7

Consider the file created in the previous challenge. Notice its timestamps and then update them to the system’s current date and time.
Change only the modification and change time to the current system time. See the change.
Change only the modification time manually to 1990, January 15, 10:30:55 AM.

Steps to complete the challenge #7:

To consider the file created in the previous challenge, you can type ls -l --full-time ~/linux.txt in the terminal. This will show you the file permissions, ownership, size, and full timestamp of the file linux.txt in the user’s home directory.
To notice its timestamps and then update them to the system’s current date and time, you can use the touch command with the -a option. The -a option is used to change only the access time of the file to the current system time. To do this, you can type touch -a ~/linux.txt in the terminal. This will update the access time of the file to the current system time, but leave the modification and change time unchanged. You can verify this by typing stat ~/linux.txt in the terminal, which will show you the file attributes and the file timestamps.
To change only the modification and change time to the current system time, you can use the touch command with the -m option. The -m option is used to change only the modification time of the file to the current system time. However, this will also change the change time of the file, since the file metadata is changed. To do this, you can type touch -m ~/linux.txt in the terminal. This will update the modification and change time of the file to the current system time, but leave the access time unchanged. You can verify this by typing stat ~/linux.txt in the terminal, which will show you the file attributes and the file timestamps.
To change only the modification time manually to 1990, January 15, 10:30:55 AM, you can use the touch command with the -t option. The -t option is used to change the modification time of the file to a specified date and time. The date and time should be in the format [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss], where CC is the century, YY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day, hh is the hour, mm is the minute, and ss is the second. To do this, you can type touch -t 199001151030.55 ~/linux.txt in the terminal. This will update the modification time of the file to 1990, January 15, 10:30:55 AM, but leave the access and change time unchanged. You can verify this by typing stat ~/linux.txt in the terminal, which will show you the file attributes and the file timestamps.
*** Dumitrescu: uses in the same line touch -m -t 199001151030.55 linux.txt and without absolute path

Challenge #8

Consider the file called linux.txt created in the previous challenge. Notice its timestamps and then update them to the values of /etc/passwd. See the changes.

Here are the steps to complete the challenge #8:

- To consider the file called linux.txt created in the previous challenge, you can type `ls -l --full-time ~/linux.txt` in the terminal. This will show you the file permissions, ownership, size, and full timestamp of the file linux.txt in the user's home directory.
- To notice its timestamps and then update them to the values of /etc/passwd, you can use the touch command with the -r option. The -r option is used to change the timestamps of a file to match those of another file. The /etc/passwd file is a system file that contains information about the users on the system, such as their usernames, passwords, user IDs, group IDs, home directories, and login shells. To do this, you can type `touch -r /etc/passwd ~/linux.txt` in the terminal. This will update the access, modification, and change time of the file linux.txt to match those of the file /etc/passwd.
- To see the changes, you can type `stat ~/linux.txt` and `stat /etc/passwd` in the terminal. This will show you the file attributes and the file timestamps of both files. You will notice that the timestamps of linux.txt are now the same as those of /etc/passwd.

Challenge #9

List the contents of /var/log displaying the access time of the files and sorting by filenames in reverse order.

Here are the steps to complete the challenge #9:

- To list the contents of /var/log displaying the access time of the files and sorting by filenames in reverse order, you can use the ls command with the -u, -r, and -t options. The -u option is used to display the access time of the files, instead of the modification time. The -r option is used to reverse the order of the output, so that the files are sorted by filenames in descending order. The -t option is used to sort the files by time, which in this case is the access time. To do this, you can type `ls -urt /var/log` in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /var/log directory, along with their access time, sorted by filenames in reverse order.
