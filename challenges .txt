Paths, ls, File Timestamps and Types, Viewing Files

Challenge #1

Move into the current user’s home directory using the cd command.
List the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path.
Display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and an absolute path.
Move into the root directory (/) using an absolute path.
List the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path.

Copilot:
To move into the current user’s home directory using the cd command, you can type cd ~ or cd $HOME in the terminal. The tilde (~) and the environment variable $HOME both represent the current user’s home directory.
To list the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path, you can type ls /etc in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /etc directory, which contains system configuration files.
To display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and an absolute path, you can type cat /var/log/dmesg in the terminal. This will show you the output of the dmesg command, which prints the messages from the kernel ring buffer. The /var/log/dmesg file stores these messages for later inspection.
To move into the root directory (/) using an absolute path, you can type cd / in the terminal. This will change your current working directory to the root directory, which is the top-level directory in the file system hierarchy.
To list the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path, you can repeat the same command as before: ls /etc. This will show you the same output as before, since you are listing the same directory.

Challenge #2

Move into the current user’s home directory using the cd command and an absolute path.
List the contents of the current directory using the ls command and a relative path.
List the contents of /home using the ls command and an absolute path.
List the contents of /home using the ls command and a relative path.
List the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path.
List the contents of /etc using the ls command and a relative path.
Display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and an absolute path.
Display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and a relative path.

To move into the current user’s home directory using the cd command and an absolute path, you need to know the name of the current user. You can find out the name of the current user by typing `whoami` in the terminal. This will print the username of the current user. For example, if the current user is named alice, then the absolute path of the home directory is /home/alice. To change the current working directory to the home directory, you can type `cd /home/alice` in the terminal.
To list the contents of the current directory using the ls command and a relative path, you can simply type `ls` in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the current directory, which is the home directory in this case. A relative path is a path that does not start with a slash (/), and is relative to the current working directory. For example, if you want to list the contents of the Documents directory inside the home directory, you can type `ls Documents` in the terminal.
To list the contents of /home using the ls command and an absolute path, you can type `ls /home` in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /home directory, which contains the home directories of all the users on the system. An absolute path is a path that starts with a slash (/), and is not dependent on the current working directory. For example, if you want to list the contents of the /etc directory, you can type `ls /etc` in the terminal, regardless of where you are.
To list the contents of /home using the ls command and a relative path, you need to know the relative path from the current working directory to the /home directory. Since the current working directory is the home directory of the current user, the relative path to the /home directory is .. (two dots). The two dots represent the parent directory of the current directory. To list the contents of the /home directory using a relative path, you can type `ls ..` in the terminal.
To list the contents of /etc using the ls command and an absolute path, you can type `ls /etc` in the terminal, as mentioned before. This will show you the same output as before, since you are listing the same directory.
To list the contents of /etc using the ls command and a relative path, you need to know the relative path from the current working directory to the /etc directory. Since the current working directory is the home directory of the current user, the relative path to the /etc directory is ../../etc. The ../../ represents the parent directory of the parent directory of the current directory, which is the root directory (/). To list the contents of the /etc directory using a relative path, you can type `ls ../../etc` in the terminal.
To display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and an absolute path, you can type `cat /var/log/dmesg` in the terminal, as mentioned before. This will show you the same output as before, since you are displaying the same file.
To display the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and a relative path, you need to know the relative path from the current working directory to the /var/log/dmesg file. Since the current working directory is the home directory of the current user, the relative path to the /var/log/dmesg file is ../../var/log/dmesg. To display the contents of the /var/log/dmesg file using a relative path, you can type `cat ../../var/log/dmesg` in the terminal.

Challenge #3

Move into the root directory (/) using the cd command and an absolute path.
Display the contents of /var/log/boot.log using the cat command and a relative path.
Run the previous command as root.
Move to /var/log directory using an absolute path.
Display the contents of the Desktop directory using both an absolute and relative path.
Here are the steps to complete the challenge #3:

- To move into the root directory (/) using the cd command and an absolute path, you can type `cd /` in the terminal. This will change your current working directory to the root directory, which is the top-level directory in the file system hierarchy.
- To display the contents of /var/log/boot.log using the cat command and a relative path, you need to know the relative path from the current working directory to the /var/log/boot.log file. Since the current working directory is the root directory (/), the relative path to the /var/log/boot.log file is var/log/boot.log. To display the contents of the /var/log/boot.log file using a relative path, you can type `cat var/log/boot.log` in the terminal. This will show you the messages from the boot process of the system.
*** the above throws error sudo is needed 
- To run the previous command as root, you need to use the sudo command, which allows you to execute commands as another user, usually the superuser or root. The root user has the highest privileges and can access and modify any file or directory on the system. To run the previous command as root, you can type `sudo cat var/log/boot.log` in the terminal. This will prompt you to enter your password, and then display the contents of the /var/log/boot.log file as root.
- To move to /var/log directory using an absolute path, you can type `cd /var/log` in the terminal. This will change your current working directory to the /var/log directory, which contains various log files from different system services and applications.
- To display the contents of the Desktop directory using both an absolute and relative path, you need to know the absolute and relative paths from the current working directory to the Desktop directory. The absolute path of the Desktop directory is /home/username/Desktop, where username is the name of the current user. You can find out the name of the current user by typing `whoami` in the terminal. The relative path of the Desktop directory is ../../home/username/Desktop, which means going up two levels from the current directory (/var/log) to the root directory (/), and then going down to the home directory (/home), the user's home directory (/home/username), and the Desktop directory (/home/username/Desktop). To display the contents of the Desktop directory using an absolute path, you can type `ls /home/username/Desktop` in the terminal. To display the contents of the Desktop directory using a relative path, you can type `ls ../../home/username/Desktop` in the terminal. Both commands will show you the same output, which is the list of files and directories on the Desktop.
*** no ~ command as instructed in Dumitrescu solutions:
ls /home/student/Desktop/
ls ~/Desktop/
ls ../../home/student/Desktop/


Challenge #4

Display the man page of ls and search for -d option.
Display the contents of /var/log using a long listing format.
Display information about the /var/log directory in a long listing format.
Display the contents of /etc on a single column.
Display all the files and directories (including hidden ones) from the user's home directory.

Here are the steps to complete the challenge #4:

To display the man page of ls and search for -d option, you can type man ls in the terminal. This will open the manual page for the ls command, which shows the usage and options of the command. To search for the -d option, you can type / followed by -d and press Enter. This will highlight the first occurrence of the -d option in the man page. The -d option is used to list directories themselves, not their contents. To find the next occurrence of the -d option, you can press n. To exit the man page, you can press q.
To display the contents of /var/log using a long listing format, you can type ls -l /var/log in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /var/log directory, along with their permissions, ownership, size, modification date, and name. The -l option is used to use a long listing format, which provides more information than the default format.
To display information about the /var/log directory in a long listing format, you can type ls -ld /var/log in the terminal. This will show you only the information about the /var/log directory itself, not its contents. The -d option is used to list directories themselves, not their contents. The -l option is used to use a long listing format, as before.
To display the contents of /etc on a single column, you can type ls -1 /etc in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /etc directory, one per line. The -1 option is used to list one file per line, which creates a single column output.
To display all the files and directories (including hidden ones) from the user’s home directory, you can type ls -a ~ in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the user’s home directory, including those whose names start with a dot (.), which are hidden by default. The -a option is used to show all files, including hidden ones. The tilde (~) is used to represent the user’s home directory.
*** Dumitrescu solution is with -la 

Challenge #5

Display the contents of /var/log sorted by size in a human-readable format.
Rerun the previous command adding an option that omits the files that end in .log from listing.
List the contents of /etc recursively.

steps to complete the challenge #5:

To display the contents of /var/log sorted by size in a human-readable format, you can type ls -Sh /var/log in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /var/log directory, sorted by size in descending order, and with a suffix indicating the size unit (such as K for kilobytes, M for megabytes, etc.). The -S option is used to sort by size, and the -h option is used to make the sizes human-readable.
*** AI solution gives bytes in absolute numbers, Dumitrescu solution: -lSh gives the M, K bytes suffix
To rerun the previous command adding an option that omits the files that end in .log from listing, you can type ls -Sh --ignore='*.log' /var/log in the terminal. This will show you the same output as before, but without the files that end in .log. The --ignore option is used to exclude files that match a pattern, and the ‘*.log’ is a wildcard pattern that matches any file that ends with .log.
*** Dumitrescu: --hide=*.log 
To list the contents of /etc recursively, you can type ls -R /etc in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /etc directory, and also the files and directories in its subdirectories, and so on. The -R option is used to list recursively, which means to list all levels of the directory tree.
*** Dumitrescu: ls -lR /etc 

Challenge #6

Create a new file called linux.txt in the user’s home directory using the touch command.
Notice the file timestamps using both stat and ls commands.
Display the entire timestamp of the file using the ls command.

Here are the commands for challenge #6:

- To create a new file called linux.txt in the user’s home directory using the touch command, you can type `touch ~/linux.txt` in the terminal. This will create an empty file named linux.txt in the user's home directory, which is represented by the tilde (~).
- To notice the file timestamps using both stat and ls commands, you can type `stat ~/linux.txt` and `ls -l ~/linux.txt` in the terminal. This will show you the file attributes and the file permissions, ownership, size, modification date, and name, respectively. The file timestamps include the access time (atime), the modification time (mtime), and the change time (ctime), which indicate when the file was last read, written, or changed, respectively.
- To display the entire timestamp of the file using the ls command, you can type `ls -l --full-time ~/linux.txt` in the terminal. This will show you the same output as before, but with the full timestamp of the file, including the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and nanosecond. The --full-time option is used to show the full timestamp of the file.
*** Dumitrescu: ls -lu /linux.txt (from man ls:    -u     with  -lt:  sort  by, and show, access time; with -l: show access time and sort by name; otherwise: sort by access time, newest first) and everything else is not with ~


Challenge #7

Consider the file created in the previous challenge. Notice its timestamps and then update them to the system’s current date and time.
Change only the modification and change time to the current system time. See the change.
Change only the modification time manually to 1990, January 15, 10:30:55 AM.

Steps to complete the challenge #7:

To consider the file created in the previous challenge, you can type ls -l --full-time ~/linux.txt in the terminal. This will show you the file permissions, ownership, size, and full timestamp of the file linux.txt in the user’s home directory.
To notice its timestamps and then update them to the system’s current date and time, you can use the touch command with the -a option. The -a option is used to change only the access time of the file to the current system time. To do this, you can type touch -a ~/linux.txt in the terminal. This will update the access time of the file to the current system time, but leave the modification and change time unchanged. You can verify this by typing stat ~/linux.txt in the terminal, which will show you the file attributes and the file timestamps.
To change only the modification and change time to the current system time, you can use the touch command with the -m option. The -m option is used to change only the modification time of the file to the current system time. However, this will also change the change time of the file, since the file metadata is changed. To do this, you can type touch -m ~/linux.txt in the terminal. This will update the modification and change time of the file to the current system time, but leave the access time unchanged. You can verify this by typing stat ~/linux.txt in the terminal, which will show you the file attributes and the file timestamps.
To change only the modification time manually to 1990, January 15, 10:30:55 AM, you can use the touch command with the -t option. The -t option is used to change the modification time of the file to a specified date and time. The date and time should be in the format [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss], where CC is the century, YY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day, hh is the hour, mm is the minute, and ss is the second. To do this, you can type touch -t 199001151030.55 ~/linux.txt in the terminal. This will update the modification time of the file to 1990, January 15, 10:30:55 AM, but leave the access and change time unchanged. You can verify this by typing stat ~/linux.txt in the terminal, which will show you the file attributes and the file timestamps.
*** Dumitrescu: uses in the same line touch -m -t 199001151030.55 linux.txt and without absolute path

Challenge #8

Consider the file called linux.txt created in the previous challenge. Notice its timestamps and then update them to the values of /etc/passwd. See the changes.

Here are the steps to complete the challenge #8:

- To consider the file called linux.txt created in the previous challenge, you can type `ls -l --full-time ~/linux.txt` in the terminal. This will show you the file permissions, ownership, size, and full timestamp of the file linux.txt in the user's home directory.
- To notice its timestamps and then update them to the values of /etc/passwd, you can use the touch command with the -r option. The -r option is used to change the timestamps of a file to match those of another file. The /etc/passwd file is a system file that contains information about the users on the system, such as their usernames, passwords, user IDs, group IDs, home directories, and login shells. To do this, you can type `touch -r /etc/passwd ~/linux.txt` in the terminal. This will update the access, modification, and change time of the file linux.txt to match those of the file /etc/passwd.
- To see the changes, you can type `stat ~/linux.txt` and `stat /etc/passwd` in the terminal. This will show you the file attributes and the file timestamps of both files. You will notice that the timestamps of linux.txt are now the same as those of /etc/passwd.

Challenge #9

List the contents of /var/log displaying the access time of the files and sorting by filenames in reverse order.

Here are the steps to complete the challenge #9:

- To list the contents of /var/log displaying the access time of the files and sorting by filenames in reverse order, you can use the ls command with the -u, -r, and -t options. The -u option is used to display the access time of the files, instead of the modification time. The -r option is used to reverse the order of the output, so that the files are sorted by filenames in descending order. The -t option is used to sort the files by time, which in this case is the access time. To do this, you can type `ls -urt /var/log` in the terminal. This will show you all the files and directories in the /var/log directory, along with their access time, sorted by filenames in reverse order.

*** Dumitrescu solution: ls -lu --reverse /var/log

COPILOT ANSWER:
Here are the steps to complete the challenge #10:

- To notice and try to recognize all Linux file types by running ls -l, ls -F and file commands, you need to understand the meaning of the output of these commands. The ls -l command shows the file permissions, ownership, size, modification date, and name of the files and directories in a long listing format. The ls -F command shows the file names with a trailing character that indicates the file type, such as / for directories, * for executable files, @ for symbolic links, = for sockets, | for FIFOs, and nothing for regular files. The file command shows the file type and some additional information based on the file content, such as text, binary, image, compressed, etc.
- To run the commands on the following files, you can type the commands followed by the file name in the terminal. For example, to run the ls -l command on the /etc/passwd file, you can type `ls -l /etc/passwd` in the terminal. This will show you the output of the command for the specified file. You can repeat the same process for the other commands and files. Here are the outputs of the commands for the given files:

  - /etc/passwd
    - ls -l: `-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2380 Mar  8 10:15 /etc/passwd`
    - ls -F: `/etc/passwd`
    - file: `/etc/passwd: ASCII text`

  - /var
    - ls -l: `drwxr-xr-x 14 root root 4096 Apr  6 11:54 /var`
    - ls -F: `/var/`
    - file: `/var: directory`
  *** Dumitrescu: ls -ld /var and ls -ldF /var 

  - /vmlinuz
    - ls -l: `lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 27 Mar  8 10:15 /vmlinuz -> boot/vmlinuz-5.4.0-70-generic`
    - ls -F: `/vmlinuz@`
    - file: `/vmlinuz: symbolic link to boot/vmlinuz-5.4.0-70-generic`
  - /usr/bin/ls
    - ls -l: `-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 133832 Feb 18  2020 /usr/bin/ls`
    - ls -F: `/usr/bin/ls*`
    - file: `/usr/bin/ls: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=f25dfd7b95be4ba386fd71080accae8c0732b711, stripped`
  - /dev/sda1
    - ls -l: `brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 1 Mar  8 10:15 /dev/sda1`
    - ls -F: `/dev/sda1`
    - file: `/dev/sda1: block special (8/1)`
  - /dev/tty1
    - ls -l: `crw--w---- 1 root tty 4, 1 Mar  8 10:15 /dev/tty1`
    - ls -F: `/dev/tty1`
    - file: `/dev/tty1: character special (4/1)`
  - /run/initctl
    - ls -l: `prw------- 1 root root 0 Apr  6 11:54 /run/initctl`
    - ls -F: `/run/initctl|`
    - file: `/run/initctl: fifo (named pipe)`
  - /run/snapd.socket
    - ls -l: `srw-rw-rw- 1 root root 0 Apr  6 11:54 /run/snapd.socket`
    - ls -F: `/run/snapd.socket=`
    - file: `/run/snapd.socket: socket`

- To recognize the file types based on the output of the commands, you can look at the following clues:
  - The first character of the ls -l output indicates the file type, such as - for regular files, d for directories, l for symbolic links, b for block devices, c for character devices, p for FIFOs, and s for sockets.
  - The trailing character of the ls -F output indicates the file type, as explained before.
  - The file command output shows the file type and some additional information, such as text, binary, image, compressed, etc.

  Challenge #11

List the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and displaying the line numbers as well.

student@ubuntu-22:~$ cat -n /var/log/dmesg

Copilot is right: 
Here are the steps to complete the challenge #11:
To list the contents of /var/log/dmesg using the cat command and displaying the line numbers as well, you can use the cat command with the -n option. The -n option is used to number all output lines, starting from 1. To do this, you can type cat -n /var/log/dmesg in the terminal. This will show you the output of the dmesg command, which prints the messages from the kernel ring buffer, along with the line numbers. The /var/log/dmesg file stores these messages for later inspection.

*** Dumitrescu: totally mess, send as answer to something totally different: cat -n /etc/resolv.conf

Challenge #12

Display the contents of /etc/ssh/ssh_config page by page using less.
Go to the end and then to the beginning of the file using the right shortcuts.
Search forward for the string Ciphers 
Quit less

My take: 
student@ubuntu-22:~$ less /etc/ssh/ssh_config
G 
g 
/Ciphers 
q 



Copilot: 
Here are the steps to complete the challenge #12:

To display the contents of /etc/ssh/ssh_config page by page using less, you can type less /etc/ssh/ssh_config in the terminal. This will open the file in the less command, which is a pager program that allows you to view large files in a scrollable and searchable way. The /etc/ssh/ssh_config file contains the global configuration options for the OpenSSH client, such as the host name, port number, encryption algorithms, authentication methods, etc.
To go to the end and then to the beginning of the file using the right shortcuts, you can use the following keys in the less command:
To go to the end of the file, you can press G. This will move the cursor to the last line of the file and show the end-of-file marker (EOF).
To go to the beginning of the file, you can press g. This will move the cursor to the first line of the file and show the beginning-of-file marker (BOF).
To search forward for the string Ciphers, you can use the following steps in the less command:
To start a forward search, you can press /. This will prompt you to enter a pattern to search for.
To enter the string Ciphers, you can type Ciphers and press Enter. This will highlight the first occurrence of the string Ciphers in the file and move the cursor to that line.
To find the next occurrence of the string Ciphers, you can press n. This will highlight the next occurrence of the string Ciphers in the file and move the cursor to that line.
To repeat the search, you can press n again, until you reach the end of the file or the string Ciphers is not found.
To quit less, you can press q. This will exit the less command and return to the terminal prompt.

Here are the steps to complete the challenge #13:

- To display the first 3 lines of /etc/passwd, you can use the head command with the -n option. The head command shows the beginning of a file, and the -n option specifies the number of lines to display. To do this, you can type `head -n 3 /etc/passwd` in the terminal. This will show you the first 3 lines of the /etc/passwd file, which contains information about the users on the system, such as their usernames, passwords, user IDs, group IDs, home directories, and login shells.
- To display the last 5 lines of /etc/shadow, you can use the tail command with the -n option. The tail command shows the end of a file, and the -n option specifies the number of lines to display. To do this, you can type `tail -n 5 /etc/shadow` in the terminal. This will show you the last 5 lines of the /etc/shadow file, which contains the encrypted passwords of the users on the system, along with some password aging information, such as the last change date, the minimum and maximum password age, the warning period, the inactivity period, and the expiration date.
- To display the contents of /etc/group starting with line 5, you can use the tail command with the -n option and a + sign. The tail command shows the end of a file, and the -n option specifies the number of lines to display. However, if you add a + sign before the number, it means to display the lines starting from that number, counting from the beginning of the file. To do this, you can type `tail -n +5 /etc/group` in the terminal. This will show you the contents of the /etc/group file, starting from line 5. The /etc/group file contains information about the groups on the system, such as their names, passwords, group IDs, and members.


Challenge #14

Display the last 12 lines of /var/log/auth.log in real-time.
Become root in another terminal and notice how the display is automatically updated.

Here are the steps to complete the challenge #14:

- To display the last 12 lines of /var/log/auth.log in real-time, you can use the tail command with the -f and -n options. The tail command shows the end of a file, and the -f option makes it follow the file as it grows, showing the new lines as they are added. The -n option specifies the number of lines to display. To do this, you can type `tail -f -n 12 /var/log/auth.log` in the terminal. This will show you the last 12 lines of the /var/log/auth.log file, which contains the authentication messages from the system, such as login attempts, password changes, privilege escalations, etc.
- To become root in another terminal and notice how the display is automatically updated, you can use the sudo command with the -i option. The sudo command allows you to execute commands as another user, usually the superuser or root. The root user has the highest privileges and can access and modify any file or directory on the system. The -i option makes the sudo command run a login shell as the target user, which means that it will set the environment variables and the home directory of the root user. To do this, you can type `sudo -i` in another terminal. This will prompt you to enter your password, and then switch to the root user. You will notice that the prompt changes from $ to #, indicating that you are now the root user. You can also type `whoami` in the terminal to confirm that you are the root user. If you perform any action that affects the authentication messages, such as logging out, logging in, changing passwords, etc., you will notice that the display of the tail command in the first terminal is automatically updated with the new lines. This shows that the tail command is following the file in real-time. To exit the root user, you can type `exit` in the terminal. This will return you to your normal user.
