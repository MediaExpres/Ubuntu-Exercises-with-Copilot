Challenge #1
Create the following directory structure

student@ubuntu-22:~$ tree ~/linux
/home/student/linux
├── centos
│   ├── commands.txt
│   ├── security.txt
│   └── updates
│       └── latest
└── ubuntu
    └── apt.txt

3 directories, 4 files
student@ubuntu-22:~$

My solution: I did it with GUI after I screwed it with something simmilar Dumitrescu's solution :)

Copilot solution:
To create the directory structure that you requested, you can use the following commands in your terminal:

- First, you need to create the linux directory in your home directory, if it does not exist already. You can use the command `mkdir ~/linux` to do that.
- Next, you need to create the centos and ubuntu subdirectories inside the linux directory. You can use the command `mkdir ~/linux/centos ~/linux/ubuntu` to do that.
- Then, you need to create the files commands.txt, security.txt, and updates/latest inside the centos subdirectory. You can use the command `touch ~/linux/centos/commands.txt ~/linux/centos/security.txt ~/linux/centos/updates/latest` to do that. The touch command will create empty files with the given names. You can edit them later with your preferred text editor.
- Finally, you need to create the file apt.txt inside the ubuntu subdirectory. You can use the command `touch ~/linux/ubuntu/apt.txt` to do that.

After running these commands, you should have the directory structure that you wanted. You can verify it by using the command `tree ~/linux`, which will display the tree-like representation of the directory and its contents. Here is an example of how it should look like:

student@ubuntu-22:~$ tree ~/linux
/home/student/linux
├── centos
│   ├── commands.txt
│   ├── security.txt
│   └── updates
│       └── latest
└── ubuntu
    └── apt.txt

3 directories, 4 files
student@ubuntu-22:~$
I hope this helps you to create the directory structure that you wanted. If you need more information, you can search the web


Challenge #2

Considering this directory structure, copy the file called security.txt  to the updates directory.

My solution: 

student@ubuntu-22:~$ cp ~/security.txt ~/updates
cp: cannot stat '/home/student/security.txt': No such file or directory
student@ubuntu-22:~$ cd centos
bash: cd: centos: No such file or directory
student@ubuntu-22:~$ cd linux
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux$ cd student
bash: cd: student: No such file or directory
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux$ cd centos
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ cp security.txt ~/updates
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ tree ~/linux
/home/student/linux
├── centos
│   ├── commands.txt
│   ├── security.txt
│   └── updates
│       └── latest
└── ubuntu
    └── apt.txt
3 directories, 4 files
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ cp ~/linux/centos/security.txt ~/linux/centos/updates
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ tree ~linux
~linux  [error opening dir]
0 directories, 0 files
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ tree ~/linux
/home/student/linux
├── centos
│   ├── commands.txt
│   ├── security.txt
│   └── updates
│       ├── latest
│       └── security.txt
└── ubuntu
    └── apt.txt

3 directories, 5 files
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ ^C
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ 

COPILOT solution:
To copy the file called security.txt to the updates directory, you can use the following command in your terminal:

- First, you need to navigate to the centos subdirectory inside the linux directory, where the security.txt file is located. You can use the command `cd ~/linux/centos` to do that.
- Next, you need to use the cp command to copy the security.txt file to the updates subdirectory. You can use the command `cp security.txt updates` to do that. The cp command will copy the file from the source to the destination, preserving the original file. You can also use the -v option to see the details of the copying process, such as `cp -v security.txt updates`.
- Alternatively, you can use the full path of the source and destination files, without changing the current directory. You can use the command `cp ~/linux/centos/security.txt ~/linux/centos/updates` to do that.

After running the command, you should have a copy of the security.txt file in the updates directory. 

Challenge #3

Considering the solution from the previous challenge remove the file called security.txt from the directory called updates.

My solution:
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ tree ~/linux
/home/student/linux
├── centos
│   ├── commands.txt
│   ├── security.txt
│   └── updates
│       ├── latest
│       └── security.txt
└── ubuntu
    └── apt.txt
3 directories, 5 files
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ rm ~/linux/centos/updates/security.txt
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ tree ~/linux
/home/student/linux
├── centos
│   ├── commands.txt
│   ├── security.txt
│   └── updates
│       └── latest
└── ubuntu
    └── apt.txt
3 directories, 4 files
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$

COPILOT solution:
To remove the file called security.txt from the directory called updates, you can use the following command in your terminal:

First, you need to navigate to the centos subdirectory inside the linux directory, where the updates directory is located. You can use the command cd ~/linux/centos to do that.
Next, you need to use the rm command to remove the security.txt file from the updates directory. You can use the command rm updates/security.txt to do that. The rm command will delete the file permanently, without moving it to the trash. You can also use the -v option to see the details of the deletion process, such as rm -v updates/security.txt.
Alternatively, you can use the full path of the file, without changing the current directory. You can use the command rm ~/linux/centos/updates/security.txt to do that.
After running the command, you should have removed the security.txt file from the updates directory.

Challenge #4
Considering the initial directory structure, copy the directory called updates from centos to ubuntu.

Copilot:
To copy the directory called updates from centos to ubuntu, you can use the `cp` command with the `-r` option, which means recursive. The syntax is `cp -r source destination`. In this case, the source is `/home/student/linux/centos/updates` and the destination is `/home/student/linux/ubuntu`. So, the command would be:

```bash
cp -r /home/student/linux/centos/updates /home/student/linux/ubuntu
```

This will copy the updates directory and its contents to the ubuntu directory. You can verify the result by using the `tree` command again.

it works:
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ cp -r /home/student/linux/centos/updates /home/student/linux/ubuntu
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ tree ~/linux
/home/student/linux
├── centos
│   ├── commands.txt
│   ├── security.txt
│   └── updates
│       └── latest
└── ubuntu
    ├── apt.txt
    └── updates
        └── latest
4 directories, 5 files
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$

Challenge #5
Considering the solution from the previous challenge, remove the directory called updates from ubuntu directory.
 
Copilot verified:
tudent@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ rm -r /home/student/linux/ubuntu/updates
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ tree ~/linux
/home/student/linux
├── centos
│   ├── commands.txt
│   ├── security.txt
│   └── updates
│       └── latest
└── ubuntu
    └── apt.txt
3 directories, 4 files
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ 

Dumitrescu: rm -rf ~/linux/ubunu/updates 

difference explained by Copilot:

what is the difference between  rm -rf and rm -r in ubuntu terinal
Copy
Searching for: rm -rf and rm -r in ubuntu terminal
Generating answers for you…
The difference between rm -rf and rm -r in Ubuntu terminal is that the -f option means force, which means it will ignore nonexistent files, never prompt, and delete everything without asking. The -r option means recursive, which means it will delete the directory and its contents, including subdirectories. If you use rm -r without -f, you may be asked to confirm some deletions, especially if the files are write-protected. If you use rm -rf, you will not be asked anything, and all the files and directories will be deleted permanently. Therefore, you should be very careful when using rm -rf, as it can cause data loss or damage if you make a mistake.

Challenge #6
Considering the initial directory structure and using only one command copy the file called apt.txt and the directory called updates to linux directory.
Copilot & check:
To copy the file called apt.txt and the directory called updates to linux directory, you can use the `cp` command with the `-r` option, which means recursive. The syntax is `cp -r source destination`. In this case, the sources are `/home/student/linux/ubuntu/apt.txt` and `/home/student/linux/centos/updates`, and the destination is `/home/student/linux`. So, the command would be:

```bash
cp -r /home/student/linux/ubuntu/apt.txt /home/student/linux/centos/updates /home/student/linux
```

This will copy the apt.txt file and the updates directory and its contents to the linux directory. You can verify the result by using the `tree` command again.

student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ cp -r /home/student/linux/ubuntu/apt.txt /home/student/linux/centos/updates /home/student/linux
student@ubuntu-22:~/linux/centos$ tree ~/linux
/home/student/linux
