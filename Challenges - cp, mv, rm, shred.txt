Create the following directory structure

student@ubuntu-22:~$ tree ~/linux
/home/student/linux
├── centos
│   ├── commands.txt
│   ├── security.txt
│   └── updates
│       └── latest
└── ubuntu
    └── apt.txt

3 directories, 4 files
student@ubuntu-22:~$

My solution: I did it with GUI :)

Copilot solution:
To create the directory structure that you requested, you can use the following commands in your terminal:

- First, you need to create the linux directory in your home directory, if it does not exist already. You can use the command `mkdir ~/linux` to do that.
- Next, you need to create the centos and ubuntu subdirectories inside the linux directory. You can use the command `mkdir ~/linux/centos ~/linux/ubuntu` to do that.
- Then, you need to create the files commands.txt, security.txt, and updates/latest inside the centos subdirectory. You can use the command `touch ~/linux/centos/commands.txt ~/linux/centos/security.txt ~/linux/centos/updates/latest` to do that. The touch command will create empty files with the given names. You can edit them later with your preferred text editor.
- Finally, you need to create the file apt.txt inside the ubuntu subdirectory. You can use the command `touch ~/linux/ubuntu/apt.txt` to do that.

After running these commands, you should have the directory structure that you wanted. You can verify it by using the command `tree ~/linux`, which will display the tree-like representation of the directory and its contents. Here is an example of how it should look like:

student@ubuntu-22:~$ tree ~/linux
/home/student/linux
├── centos
│   ├── commands.txt
│   ├── security.txt
│   └── updates
│       └── latest
└── ubuntu
    └── apt.txt

3 directories, 4 files
student@ubuntu-22:~$
I hope this helps you to create the directory structure that you wanted. If you need more information, you can search the web
